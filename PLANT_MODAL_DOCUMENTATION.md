  - Category (Vegetable, Herb, Fruit, Indoor Plant, Succulent)
  - Watering frequency
  - Sunlight requirements
  - Soil type
  - Growth time
  - Difficulty level
  - Spacing requirements

### 4. **Plant Cards**
Each plant is displayed in a visually appealing card with:

- "Add to My Garden" button

### 5. **Add to Garden Functionality**

- Visual feedback on button click
- Stores additional metadata:
  - Date added

## Files Modified/Created

3. **`PLANT_MODAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - This documentation file

### Modified Files:

2. **`style.css`**

   - Includes responsive design for mobile devices
   - Custom scrollbar styling
   - Hover effects and animations

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Click on the "Add a Plant" button on the homepage
2. Browse through the available plants
3. Use the search bar to find specific plants
4. Filter by category using the dropdown
5. Click "Add to My Garden" on any plant card
6. The plant will be saved to your personal garden
7. Close the modal by:
   - Clicking the X button
   - Clicking outside the modal
   - Pressing the Escape key

### For Developers:

#### To Add More Plants:
Edit `plants-database.json` and add new plant objects following this structure:
```json
{
  "id": 13,
  "name": "Plant Name",
  "scientificName": "Scientific Name",
  "category": "Category",
  "wateringFrequency": "Frequency",
  "sunlight": "Sunlight needs",
  "soilType": "Soil type",
  "growthTime": "Growth time",
  "difficulty": "Easy/Moderate/Hard",
  "spacing": "Spacing",
  "image": "image.jpg"
}
```

#### To Customize Styling:
Modify the CSS classes in `style.css`:
- `.plant-modal` - Modal overlay
- `.plant-modal-content` - Modal container
- `.plant-card` - Individual plant cards
- `.modal-header` - Modal header styling
- `.add-plant-btn` - Add button styling

#### To Modify Functionality:
Edit `plant-modal.js`:
- `loadPlantsData()` - Loads plants from JSON
- `displayPlants()` - Renders plant cards
- `filterPlants()` - Handles search/filter
- `addPlantToGarden()` - Saves plant to localStorage

## Data Storage

Plants added to the garden are stored in localStorage under the key `myGarden` as a JSON array. Each entry includes:
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Tomato",
  scientificName: "Solanum lycopersicum",
  category: "Vegetable",
  // ... all other plant properties
  addedDate: "2025-10-13T19:10:00.000Z",
  lastWatered: null,
  notes: ""
}
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses ES6+ features (async/await, arrow functions)
- LocalStorage support required

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements:
1. Connect to actual Excel file data using a backend service
2. Add plant care reminders integration
3. Add plant growth tracking
4. Include more detailed plant information (pests, diseases, etc.)
5. Add user ratings and reviews
6. Include planting calendar based on location
7. Add companion planting suggestions

## Troubleshooting

### Modal doesn't open:
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `plant-modal.js` is loaded
- Verify the button ID is `add-plant-btn`

### Plants don't display:
- Check if `plants-database.json` is accessible
- Verify JSON file is valid
- Check browser console for fetch errors

### Images not showing:
- Ensure image files exist in the root directory
- Check image paths in `plants-database.json`
- Fallback to `default.jpg` is automatic
